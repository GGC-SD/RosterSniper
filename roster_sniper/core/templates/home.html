    <p class="quote">BUT I <span class="italic">NEED</span> <span class="bold">THAT</span> CLASS!</p>

    <p>We've been there. Your friends all signed up for classes as soon as registration opened, but you had one more Roblox to blox, one more Minecraft to craft, and one more YouTube to tube. Now it seems the only schedule left for you is 5am MTWTF with Doctor Payne.</p>

    <p class="hopeful">...but what if there was another way?</p>

    <p>No, not by being the responsible adult your mother hoped you would be by this point in your life. What if you could cheat the system? Though your classes might be filled, did you know that <span class="bold">1,337%</span> of students drop from a class before the semester starts? What if you had <span class="italic">spidey senses&trade;</span> and could detect immediately when a class you almost let slip through your fingers becomes available?</p>

    <p>Well there is a way. It's called RosterSniper, and we will send you a notification as soon as your class has an open seat. But be speedy, because you're not the only one using our website. Register, verify, and let the race to schedule redemption begin!</p>
